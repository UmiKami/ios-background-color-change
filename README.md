## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

My favorite apps:

+ Reddit
  - Post threads system
  - Easy to use post filtering system
+ YouTube
  - Video loads on thumbnail instead of on dedicated view
  - Ambient light around video being played
  - Short format videos
  - Quick infinite scrolling
+ Telegram
  - Smooth UI transitions 
  - Highly customizable chat window 
  - In-call privacy check with emoji sequence matching 
  
My dream app:

  I want to create an app that displays the weekly status of on-going shows. I want the app to have a widget like the apple calendar, that displays the shows being aired for the current day. I would also want the app to keep track of my favorite shows and recommend upcming shows that may be on my interest.

## Notes

- Had a hard time finding the right method to open the map app. It ended being a lot easier than I thought; usually in other languages, there is a lot more verbose involved to perform similar operations.
- Understanding how tap gesture work was tough since in web frameworks or even in Java, "on click" or "on tap" actions are usually more straightforward and faster to code out. Of course this is subjective since it may just be different not harder.
